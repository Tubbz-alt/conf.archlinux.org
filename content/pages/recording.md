All accepted submissions needs to be recorded and sent inn to conf@archlinux.org
by 5th of October. This details resources for recording the conference talk.

The C3VOC has written excellent documentation when it comes to creating a
recording setup at home and is well worth the read!

[https://c3voc.de/wiki/distributed-conference]()

The following assets are recommended to have a consistent conference, but
they are not required if you the presenter has a more comfortable setup already.

For the recording of the talk we recommend using [Open-Broadcaster
Software](https://obsproject.com/) as it's easy for people to setup the screen
for a presentation. We also provide a layout one can use as a guideline.


The [OBS Stream Profile](/presentation/ArchConfOBSScene.json) can be loaded
through Profile -> Import.

presentation screen and camera position.

A [clean background](/presentation/cleanbanner.png) without any guidance lines
for alternative setups.
