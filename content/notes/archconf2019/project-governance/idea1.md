Election of a "Temporary dictator"

Randomly select 3 people from pool of Developers+Trusted Users
They can opt-out, in which case a new person is selected (at random) to replace them
Alternatively, they may "campaign" for one of their opponents
Non-chosen Developers and TUs then vote for the new leader in an instant-run-off vote 
They serve for 1 year
Rationale: anything more is too much to ask as a time commitment via random process


"Reluctant leaders are the best leaders"
More likely to delegate (good!)

"I better run cause my I don't have confidence in my opponents"
The 2 people effectively have an effecitve way to "veto" an opponent 

"If I get elected I can just delegate to $UNAVAILABLE_CANDIDATE"
If you are elected and don't want the job, you are free to delegate your powers as you desire

Why a dictator?
Reduce points of contact required to get approval/permission to do something
