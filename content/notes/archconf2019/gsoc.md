# GSoC ideas

The idea is to make use of GSoC to get some projects done which require a lot of dedicated attention, which are self contained and where we have someone who wants to mentor.

Below is a list of a brainstorm session:

## Pacman

- parallel transfers https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/20056
- documentation
- secure packaging
- [pacman-dev] [RFC] Iterator interface for reading databases

## archweb

- pkgstats (official)

## Infra

- Arch Integration Test Framework
- Rebuild order script, generates a rebuild order for a package (ABI, C++)

# Security tracker

- Secure package checking
- ?????

## Namcap

- goformat for PKGBUILD
- Enhanche?

## Reproducible builds

- rebuilding infra
- making archiso reproducilbe

## Installer

- graphical installer
- "guided" installer giving you a terminal and walking you through install steps? I can get through an install unaided but it would be nice not to forget anything on the first try.

## AUR / aurweb

- Rewrite in Python
  * Was done in django, declined by some contributors (relevant?)
- Support Pull Requests
- Support OAUTH
- Expose all data to clients (the web interface would just be another client)
